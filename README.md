### Project Overview

 The Project is about analyzing what happens during an IPL match which raises several questions in our mind with our limited knowledge about the game called cricket on which it is based. This analysis is done to know as to which factors led one of the team to win and how does it matter.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned
- how to open/load a yaml file
- how to traverse through the data and get the required output
- how to get insights from the information in hand


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I analyzed the data and created a flowchart of operations to be performed.
Initially, I wrote a long and complex code to get the result. Later, on referring to web I found a better way of executing the same operation in a simpler way.


### Challenges faced

 Some of the tasks and in-built functions were new to me. I understood its functionality and parameter through pydoc and stackoverflow
